Audio::Analyzer

Audio::Analyzer is a set of classes that makes doing the Fourier Transform on
PCM audio files extremely easy. Also includes an option to automatically 
iterate at boundries that gurantee an audio/visual sync at an arbitrary rate.

EXAMPLE MEDIA

The following pieces of media were done using Audio::Analyzer:
  * http://youtube.com/watch?v=C8EOtbaMT84 
  * http://youtube.com/watch?v=QfhRVnv0bw4
      Templatized PovRay scenes written out one file per frame then rendered
      into images individually with a make file.

      Imager::Graph graphs of the output of Audio::Analyzer and the internal 
      state of a software beat detector assembled with mencoder.
